1. discussion about the first command :  netstat -tpln

netstat -tpln

_ this command monitors tcp network connections. 
_ in the result we can see the PID and name of the program.
_ in the result we can see the IP:PORT pairs.
_ in the result we can see listening ports. 

example :

Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      -  


2. discussion about the second command : netstat -tpn | grep ESTABLISHED

at the first :

_ this command monitors tcp network connections.
_ in the result we can see the PID and name of the program.
_ in the result we can see the IP:PORT pairs.

then : 

_ This shows all the network connections that are established. in other hands it means that the TCP handshake has been completedf or this connections.
