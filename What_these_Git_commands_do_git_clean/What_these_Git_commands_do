* git clean -fd

git clean: This is the Git command used for removing untracked files and directories.

-f: This flag stands for "force" and is required to actually perform the clean operation. Without it, Git will only display what it would remove without actually removing anything.

-d: This flag stands for "directory" and tells Git to also remove untracked directories along with untracked files. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* git clean -fxd

-x: This flag tells Git to remove even ignored files. Ignored files are typically defined in .gitignore.

This includes files and directories that match patterns specified in the .gitignore file, ensuring that Git removes all untracked items, even those that are intentionally ignored.

upstream for a local branch with `master` name is `origin/master` in remote.
